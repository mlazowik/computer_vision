## AI at the Edge Resources and Tutorials

This page lists educational resources including tips and tutorials for machine learning starters.

### Concepts

* Microsoft Azure IoT Edge

[The source video](https://youtu.be/EbRQMncZ5XY?t=3735) talks about how AI algorithms can be modeled, packaged, managed, and possible to be running at the edge devices. A couple of examples helps how the Edge computing can be applied to scale-sensitive domains.

### Dataset management

* Data Visualization and Debugging

[The source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulLx2iPTIcs) talks about data visualization to debug dataset.

### Security

* Adversarial Examples and Their Implications

[The post](https://hackernoon.com/the-implications-of-adversarial-examples-deep-learning-bits-3-4086108287c7) talks about the possible attacks against Deeplearning-based systems. In the post, identity verification systems and self-driving vehicle systems are the systems mainly critical to those attacks.
